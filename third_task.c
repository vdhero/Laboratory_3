/*Approximating Euler's number "e" (the base of the natural logarithm)

The natural number can e=2.7182818… can be obtained by the following infinite sum:

    1    1    1    1    1
e = ── + ── + ── + ── + ── + …
    0!   1!   2!   3!   4!

Write a program to compute it with the first 20 terms! Note that the factorial can be a high number, use a double data type to store it!

Hint: if you have used nested loops, try to simplify your solution! A single loop is enough to solve the problem.*/

#include <stdio.h>
double e=1;
double n=1;
int main()
{

  for (int i = 1; i <=20; i++) 
  { 
      n=n*i;
      e=e+(1/n);
      
  }
  printf("%lf",e);
return 0;
